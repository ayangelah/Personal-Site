                    Hayley's comet is coming around again, 
                    You're half to my quarter; 
                    I'm going at light years yet you're ever parsecs from me.
                    Do you think maybe? That rare eclipses of our meetings weave something beautiful;
                    that the aching gravity of our longing created something of a binary star
                    I waltz to your steady two-beat and only once in six months—perhaps, 
                    black headed magpie notes build us a bridge.
                    Fourth night, forthright
                    -ly to walk right up towards the northern star to hold you blanketed in the black.

                    Hello new owner, of my old jeans,<br>
                    New soul in my old genes.<br>
                    I am writing to offer my affectionate sympathy.<br>
                    Sympathy in the most truest sense.<br>
                    To tell you early stories of how I broke in the stiff denim,<br>
                    And I love it because of its boy-pockets and trusty button.<br>
                    You may have noticed, how we're lucky to have a full head of hair,<br>
                    Which grows sleek and black and soft.<br>
                    I hope it brings you as much joy as it did to me.<br>
                    <br>
                    I hope also, that you don't mind the patch on the knee, where I ironed on a threaded flower.<br>
                    I ripped it open—most unfashionably so—two summers ago.<br>
                    The way our skin scrapes off seemingly endlessly as a gray mushy substance.<br>
                    Speaking of our skin, it may amuse you to hear that my own crush gently noticed<br>
                    Just how chapped our lips get, though even that did not assuage him…<br>
                    <br>
                    To tell you of my favorite parts!<br>
                    The stiff cuffs that end at the ankle, the way our thighs as well as our hips fit snugly.<br>
                    How I love the curves of our body, the little red mark on our forearm that I spend my idle time deciphering:<br>
                    A small backwards 'F', a fire, the mouth of the Loch Ness?<br>
                    The delicate webbing of our brown irises, the sweet curve of our smiles.<br>
                    <br>
                    To warn you of the vulnerabilities you must take care of:<br>
                    The inner thigh seam, which much too often wears down,<br>
                    And the jeans' faded blue.<br>
                    The way tiny eruptions form on the greasy parts of the face.<br>
                    Our intestines, which haven't figured out the water-ratio of stools, and<br>
                    The mysteries of possible lactose-intolerance and a few easter-egg benign tumors.<br>
                    <br>
                    To tell you of the secrets!<br>
                    How I'd sewn in a secret pocket behind its outer brother, for knickknacks and sweets.<br>
                    How we're missing a canine, yet all wisdom teeth are present. Unfortunate indeed.<br>
                    Possessing of wiggly-wiggly ear canals that make earplugs impossible,<br>
                    Did you know our hands could do so much? I can't wait to see what you do with them.<br>
                    <br>
                    Tell me, when you fall in love, if you had ever known you could feel such happiness.<br>

                    I've parted with, willingly and otherwise, with pieces of myself.<br>
                    Some imperceptible, my skin, strands of hair,<br>
                    Others more precious, flecks of bone, and my own flesh.<br>
                    Leaving fractions of myself behind.<br>
                    And now, I hold my blade to my neck, and blindly, seeing only cataract blue.<br>
                    So I cut, my hair, the tips of my fingers, the fish scales that fall from my eyes.<br>
                    <br>
                    I slit my skin at my throat, and I leave my shell behind.<br>
                    It feels so nice to breathe.<br>

                    In a hundred years, there is a town cautionary tale <br>
                    For a girl, as doomed by her own hubris. <br>
                    When the gods decided to bless her with talents a tenfold, in music, in arts, in mind,<br>
                    By tenfold such proportion, she was built and designed and so carefully posed,<br>
                    to worship the gods with her gifts, to write psalms with god-given ears.<br>
                    But she was a woman, cursed like Pandora was, cursed like Eve was:<br>
                    Hubris, that told her she had grown her own body, skills, and conscience.<br>
                    And so the gods became angry.<br>
                    And she was cast out of mythos: to die in obscurity, the prodigal prodigy.<br>
                    Children, who no longer know her name, in this village, so they call her “Foolish girl” and feel a secret fear.<br>
                    Chosen, favored one! To count it worthless!<br>
                    nobody knows, nobody shows,<br>
                    The happiness a freed girl can feel.<br>

                    Today, in limbo, a sort of muted deja vu,<br>
                    Today I am packing my bags, an anniversary to a year ago, when I, a fresh faced kid packed my bags for my first months of adulthood,<br>
                    of a new school, new life, promised excitement and community.<br>
                    Today I pack with my brain, a little wiser, my heart a little stronger, because I know<br>
                    That sometimes college is a little bit of a hell, a short four year runway before we take flight.<br>
                    I worry, like so many others that my wings don't know the winds and I will not take to air, but plummet,<br>
                    Why my life unfurls ahead of me, and yet only two decades worth of years I have the luxury of certainty.<br>
                    But it is all the fun, safe flights, for so long as I keep my spirit, I will stay afloat.<br>
                    So long as there is turbulence, so too will there be glee.<br>

                    Today my insomnia stems from excitement, and not anxiety.<br>

                    I'm addicted to time.<br>
                    The hourglass knows this.<br>
                    He laughs at me and trickles the fine sand between his glass fingers.<br>
                    <br>
                    That's what time looks like by the way.<br>
                    The fourth dimension is a soluble white powder.<br>
                    A second, is a grain of sugar.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ten minutes, the extended savor of salt.<br>
                    A whole free, warm afternoon, is a powder cookie, to be missed,<br>
                    When all is left are crumbs to be licked.<br>
                    <br>
                    And a year. Is a vast hill of sweet, sweet cocaine.<br>
                    I devour this so fast that I don't see it become a day, ten minutes, all but a second.<br>
                    Which dips into a negative debt, and becomes untouchable.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sweat, which distills time from us, when we hope into a future<br>
                    Tears, for when time leaks in, when we mourn the past<br>
                    And the sea, for when time seems to stand still, and we become, nothing for a while.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are certain transitions of day, where the clock-hands stick just barely to their white faces.<br>
                    I wonder what it is like to be dying. Finding withdrawal more painful than watching<br>
                    The last second dissolve.<br>

                    I was conceived, a thought-ember<br>
                    In an artificial womb.<br>
                    Sustained, suspended, surrogate<br>
                    My thin fetal skin separating myself from welcome warmth.<br>

                    Ears, nose, eyes.<br>
                    They were connected once, you know.<br>
                    I could hear, floodlights that only made it to my membrane home in hues.<br>
                    I could taste, war outside, reduced to the diffuse vibrations that reached<br>
                    My toes.<br>
                    <br>
                    I won't lie and say I wasn't curious.<br>
                    Vividly, I'd hallucinate of a thousand different births, each where<br>
                    I tumbled out, into arms, onto soft grass, between others, just like me.<br>
                    <br>
                    But I had pressed my webbed hand against the branching vessels.<br>
                    And knew, of one certainty.<br>
                    It was cold outside.<br>
