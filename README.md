# Personal-Site

Central Hub to see all things Angela!

This is the source code for my personal site, currently deployed at ayangelah.me! I am regularly updating it with
all current events, projects, and things I'd like to share, drop on by if you'd like to get to know me!

Note-To-Self to handle module bundler:

- don't use npm run dev, it doesn't update the most recent built version.

1. change index.html in main directory to reference the src index.js
2. run npm build in the home directory
3. change the link to index.js in the dist directory in the main index.html.
4. use go live in vscode.
